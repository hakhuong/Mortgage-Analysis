#Sample Selection Criteria 

* There are 3 NAs in Married. Given our data set of almost 2,000 observation, we decided to remove these observations.
* There are values of 666 in "Guideline", which is an impossible value. We decided to remove such observations as well. 
* There are loans that is more than 100% of the purchases price. We decided to remove these observations. 

```{r include = FALSE}

#Remove NAs and impossible values

  filter(guideline != 666) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(married)) %>% 
  filter(loan<=1)%>% 
  mutate(loan = loan *100)

#Rename Race

                   ifelse((mld$black == 1) & (mld$hispanic == 0), "Non-Hispanic Black", "Hispanic"))

#Rename marital status
mld$marital <-ifelse(mld$married== 1, "Married", "Unmarried")


#Change variables levels' name:
mld$approve <- ifelse(mld$approve == 1, "Yes", "No")

```

#Descriptive statistics

##All observations analysis 

* There are twice more married applicants than unmarried applicants. 
* Most of the time, the application is approved (88% approval rate).
* Most application satisfied guidelines (91% of the time). 
* Most applicants are non-Hispanic White (85% White).

* Most loans is at 70-80% of the item purchase price. 
* Most other obligations is at 30-40% of the loan-applicant's total income.

##Descriptive statistics by race/ethnicity

* Distribution of loan/purchase price is hightly skewed left. Most people apply for high proportion of loan over price. 
    + Hispanic and Non-Hispanic Black have higher average loan amount application. 
* Across races/ethnicities, people have similar percentage of other obligations over income (about 32-35% of income).

# Probit Model

## Overall

```{r}
probit_all <- glm(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = mld)

summary(probit_all)
```

Coefficients make intuitive directional sense; marriage could be positive or negative intuitively.


## Hispanic

```{r}
probit_hispanic <- glm(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = mld_hispanic)

summary(probit_hispanic)
```

Coefficients make intuitive directional sense; marriage could be positive or negative intuitively.


## Non-Hispanic Black

```{r}
probit_black <- glm(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = mld_black)

summary(probit_black)
```

Coefficients make intuitive directional sense; marriage could be positive or negative intuitively.

## Non-Hispanic White

```{r}
probit_white <- glm(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, family = binomial(link = "probit"), data = mld_white)

summary(probit_white)

Coefficients make intuitive directional sense; marriage could be positive or negative intuitively.

# Logit Model & Odds Ratios

## Overall
```{r}
logit <- glm(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan  + marital, data = mld, family = "binomial")

summary(logit)

logitor(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, data = mld)

```

+ Keeping all other variable constant, applicants who met guidelines have 48.4 times greater odds than applicants who didn't meet guidelines to get loan approval. The coefficient is statistically significant at 1% level.

## Hispanic

```{r}
logit <- glm(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, data = mld_hispanic, family = "binomial")

summary(logit)

logitor(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, data = mld_hispanic)
```

+ Keeping all other variable constant, applicants who met guidelines have 23.1 times greater odds than applicants who didn't meet guidelines to get loan approval. The coefficient is statistically significant at 1% level.

## Non-Hispanic Black

```{r}
logit <- glm(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, data = mld_black, family = "binomial")

summary(logit)

logitor(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, data = mld_black)
```

+ Keeping all other variable constant, applicants who met guidelines have 55.6 times greater odds than applicants who didn't meet guidelines to get loan approval. The coefficient is statistically significant at 1% level.


## Non-Hispanic White
```{r}
logit <- glm(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, data = mld_white, family = "binomial")

summary(logit)

logitor(approve ~ guideline + obligation + loan + marital, data = mld_white)
```

+ Keeping all other variable constant, applicants who met guidelines have 44.7 times greater odds than applicants who didn't meet guidelines to get loan approval. The coefficient is statistically significant at 1% level.
