# RACIAL/ETHNIC GAP IN MORTGAGE APPROVAL IN BOSTON - Mortgage Lending Analysis


## Introduction 
	
  Homeownership enables improved financial security in the United States and is viewed as a right of passage in our culture. For example, families who own their own home receive more governmental and insurance aid during natural disasters than do those who rent. Since most homebuyers require a mortgage, lending institutions determine most families’ ability to purchase a home. We seek to examine unfair practices in this area that limit one group’s ability to improve their financial security by purchasing a house. Specifically, we inspect the role of racial discrimination in the mortgage lending market.
  
  Our goal for this project is to better understand the relationship between race/ethnicity and mortgage approval. We ask: is race/ethnicity associated with the outcome of a mortgage loan application? To address this question, we estimate probit and logit models of loan approval for three racial/ethnic categories: Hispanic applicants, non-Hispanic black applicants, and non-Hispanic white applicants. 

## Econometric Model and Estimation Method 
	
  In this project, we created two models to test whether minorities face different probabilities of approval than whites. The two models we used were a probit model and a logit model because each of these models force the expected value for the probability of loan approval (our dependent variable) to fall within the the range [0, 1]. 
  
Additionally, we controlled for the impact of marital status, other obligations, meeting loan guidelines, and the ratio of the loan amount to the total purchase price of the house. Since the dependent variable in this specification is the approval of mortgage, which is dichotomous, probit model and logit models were used to understand the relationship among these variables. Our null hypothesis is that the probability of approval of mortgage is no different by race/ethnicity; we look for evidence to disprove this hypothesis.

## Conclusion
	
  The analysis in this paper confirms a racial/ethnic penalty for loan applicants of minorities. We find similar magnitudes of racial/ethnic penalties for black and Hispanic applicants vs. their white counterparts, after controlling for marital status and creditworthiness. These penalties were statistically and economically significant across our models.
